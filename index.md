## Favoroite CPSC 120L Labs

-Lab 3:

    I liked Lab 3 because it gave me the opportunity to apply mathematical concepts in coding, specifically when calculating dates and days using Julian Day numbers. I enjoyed how the labchallenged me to break down complex formulas, like the Fliegel & Van Flandern equation, and translate them into functions in C++! I learned a lot about handling date calculations and ensuring the program could handle leap years, which deepened my understanding of both programming and mathematics. This lab improved my function writing skills and taught me how to approach problems by carefully structuring my code!

-Lab 5: 

    Lab 5 was a favorite because it involved converting a floating-point number into feet, inches, and eighths of an inch. I liked the challenge of ensuring that both positive and negative values were handled correctly, as well as making sure the program used the correct data types for calculations. From this lab, I learned how to clamp values within the safe range of integers, ensuring the program runs without errors. I also gained more experience with formatting and debugging code to comply with style guidelines!

-Lab 9:

    I really enjoyed Lab 9, especially because it involved working with file I/O to create a hidden guessing game. It was exciting to implement the "secret" program that writes a secret number to a file and then test the "game" program that reads from that file without revealing the secret! Through this lab, I learned how to handle errors when working with files and how to read and write data correctly, which will be helpful in future projects where data persistence is needed. This lab reinforced my understanding of how programs can interact with external files and gave me confidence in handling edge cases related to file operations!
